#### What to Focus On

- a database backed application can be slow for variety of reasons
- in general an application that makes fewer queries will be faster
- you should be aware of the concept of optimizing the way an application interacts with the database
- You should be able to describe what N+1 queries are

#### What I learned in this course
- I learned about designing database queries in an efficient way
- I learned about how we can offload some logic to the database like with the help of methods like COUNT.
